# All relevant code is in Dressometry Size Scrape.py
# 
# The task was to create a program that would pull all the sizes of every 
# dress off three major retailers, and output them in an orderly way
#  
# I used Selenium to pull the source code off the different sites
# This is a lengthy process, so to speed it up for testing
# I grabbed the source code from 100 dresses on each site
# That way you can take a look at what the code does without having
# to sit through an annoying Selenium session.
#
# The program, as it is, is set to parse through these 300 pages.
#
# The output can be seen in 'ASOSWeeklySizes.csv' 'RTRWeeklySizes.csv' 'LULUSWeeklySizes.csv'
#
# Thanks!

# Best,
